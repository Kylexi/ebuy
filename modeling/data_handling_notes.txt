This text file aims to guide the logic of the data handling
prior to fitting a model. All manipulations are listed below
along with the reasoning behind it.

Missing Data Handling by Column:
    bundle:
        The webscraper never even picked up a 'yes' option for the bundle
        (it only consists of NaNs and 'No') so we are free to drop this col.

    seller_percent:
        48/1363 missing values. Median imputation would give 100 (maximum
        score), so we'll opt for Mean instead (~99.16). There is quite low
        variance in this predictor anyways, so most likely will not have
        much impact.

    rating_count:
        289/1363 missing values. This one's tougher. Such a large number of
        missing values should be handled through a better imputation method
        like CART, but we'll stick with Median imputation again giving us
        the dominant category of 857 which is indicative of a "correctly"
        selected sell category.

    bid_summary:
        Dropping this for now, bid_duration is the relevant feature extracted.

    bid_duration:
        Filtering this down on the condition '"day" in data'. This will leave
        out the 3 data points that came out in Spanish. Amusingly, the proxy
        service sometimes will utilize servers in other countries, which then
        causes Ebay to render text in the appropriate language. Something to
        keep in mind for other users.

    Image feature columns (Disc - Multiple Cases):
        158/1363 missing values. This is the trickiest one. We are at about 12%
        data loss if we decide to drop here. We can't fill with 0's although
        it's tempting: all 0's is indicative of an IRRELEVANT image, not the
        lack of an image all together. The best way ahead here is to
        open up a new category for the missing values and treat it as its own
        option.
